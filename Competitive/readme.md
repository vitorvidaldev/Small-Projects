# Competitive Programming

Competitive Programming consists of:
- Design of algorithms
- Implementation of algorithms

C++ benefits:
- Very efficient language
- Its standard library contains a large collection of data structures and algorithms

The code can be compiled with the following command:
```
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall test.cpp -o test
```

It is not possible to become a successful competitive programmer without having good mathematical skills.

An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive numbers is constant.

A geometric progression is a sequence of numbers where the ratio between any two consecutive numbers is constant.

The time complexity of an algorithm estimates how much time the algorithm will use for some input. The idea is to represent the efficiency as a function whose parameter is the size of the input.
