# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

You can deploy a Kubernetes cluster on a local machine, into the cloud, or in your own datacenter.

A production-quality Kubernetes cluster requires planning and preparation. If your Kubernetes cluster has to run critical workloads, it must be configured to be resilient.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.

### Why you need Kubernetes and what is can do

Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more.

Key Features:
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Storage orchestration
- Automated rollouts and rollbacks
- Automatic bin packing
- Self-healing
- Secret and configuration management

### What Kubernetes is not

Kubernetes is not a traditional, all-inclusive PaaS (Platform as a Service) system. It provides the building blocks for building developer platforms, but preserves user choice and flexibility where it is important.
