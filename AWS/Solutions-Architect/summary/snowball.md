# AWS Snowball

AWS Snowball, a part of the AWS Snow Family, is an adge computing, data migration, and edge storage device that comes in two options. Snowball Edge Storage Opmized devices provide both block storage and Amazon S3-compatible object storage, and 40 vCPUs. Theyy are well suited for local storage and large scale-data transfer. Snowball Edge compute Optimized devices provide 52 vCPUs, block and object storage, and an optional GPU for use cases like advanced machine learning and full motion video analysis in disconnected environments. You can use these devices for data collection, machine learning and processing, and storage in environments with intermittent connectivity (like manufacturing, industrial, and transportation) or in extremely remote locations (like military or maritime operations) before shipping them back to AWS. These devices may also be rack mounted and clustered together to build larger temporary installations.
