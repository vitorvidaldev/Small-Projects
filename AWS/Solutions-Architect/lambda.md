# AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers. You can trigger Lambda from over 200 AWS services and software as a service (SaaS) applications, and only pay for what you use.

AWS Lambda is a serverlesss compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. These events may include changes in state or an update, such as a user placing an item in a shopping cart on an ecommerce website. AWS Lambda automatically runs code in response to multiple events, such as HTTP requests via Amazon API Gateway, modifications to objects in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, table updates in Amazon DynamoDB, and state transitions in AWS Step Functions.

AWS Lambda maintains compute capacity across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) in each AWS Region to help protect your code against individual machine or data center facility failures. Both AWS Lambda and the functions running on the service deliver predictable and reliable operational performance. AWS Lambda is designed to provide high availability for both the service itself and the functions it operates. There are no maintenance windows or scheduled downtimes.
