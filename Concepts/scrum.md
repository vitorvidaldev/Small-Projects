# Scrum

Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining products in a complex environment, with an initial emphasis on software development. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goasls that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks.

## Key ideas

A key principle of scrum is the dual recognition that customers will change the scope of what is wanted and that there will be unpredictable challenges - for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited. These changes come from a variety of sources, but according to scrum, understanding why is irrelevant, and change should simply be accepted, embraced and analyzed for benefits.
