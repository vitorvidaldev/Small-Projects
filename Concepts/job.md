# Job

A job is a unit of work or unit of execution. A componient of a job is called a task or a step. As a unit of execution, a job may be concretely identified with a single process, which may in turn have subprocesses which perform the tasks or steps that comprise the work of the job; or with a process group; or with an abstract reference to a process or process group, as in Unix job control.
