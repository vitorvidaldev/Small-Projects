# OAuth

OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.

Generally, OAuth provides clients a "secure delegated access" to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their resources without providing credentials. Deisgned specifically to work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HttP), OAuth, essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner. THe third party then uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server. In particular, OAuth 2.0 provides specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and smart devices.
