# Kanban

Kanban is a lean method to manage and improve work across human systems. This approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity, and by improving the handling of system-level bottlenecks.

Work items are visualized to give participantes a view of progress and process, from start to finish - usually via a kanban board. Work is pulled as capacity permits, rather than work being pushed into the process when requested.

## Kanban metrics

Team velocity defines how many tasks a team can deliver in a given period of time, for example a week or iteration. Velocity is calculated periodically and to help with accuracy of the calculated velocity, teams aim to create tasks that are similar in size. Knowing team velocity helps better predict when a project is going to end.

Lead and Cycle time defines the average time it takes to complete a task. Lead time is calculated since the teams gets a request from the client and cycle time is calculated since the team starts working on a task. Lead time is used to understand how long a client has to wait for their product and cycle time is used to understand how fast the team produces a product.

Actionable Agile metrics use cycle time to better predict when each project item is going to be finished. This information can be used to help the team better predict and control task delivery dates.
